The Cactus project is pleased to announce the release of version 1.7.1.
Cactus is a unit testing framework for testing server side java code.

Goals
-----

This a checkpoint release, as Cactus 1.8 will be refactored to use Cargo for container management. As such, a new branch will be created for 1.7 releases (but hopefully no other release will be necessary before 1.8).


Main new features
-----------------

- Cactus now uses Cargo for the CactifyEar task
- JDK 1.2 and 1.3 are no longer supported
