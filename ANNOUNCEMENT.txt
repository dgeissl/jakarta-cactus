The Cactus project is pleased to announce the release of version 1.6.
Cactus is a unit testing framework for testing server side java code.

Goals
-----

Primarily a bug fix release. Several usability enhancements and the 
addition of the Maven plugin as part of the Cactus distribution. Move
to the Apache 2.0 license.

Main new features
-----------------

* Added the Maven plugin. It was formerly hosted in the Maven project's
  own CVS. It is now in the Cactus CVS and is part of the Cactus 
  distribution.
* The <cactus> Ant task now supports Mac OSX.
* Added support for Resin 3.x in the <cactus> Ant task (<resin3x> element).
* Better configurability of the <cactus> container elements:
    - new configXml attribute for the <weblogic7x> element
    - added support for JBoss jboss-web.xml in the <jboss3x> element
    - new contextxml attribute for the <tomcat4x> element
    - new jndiport attribute for the <jboss3x> element
* Added new ServletContextWrapper.setInitParameters() method which allows 
  to programatically define Context init parameters.

Changes
-------

Please check the Changes page at
http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/changes.html for a full list of the 
changes in version 1.6.

Known limitations and bugs:
---------------------------

* Possible binary compatibility problem: We've had a big internal 
  restructuration: we have moved all the non public API classes to java 
  packages with the name "internal". As a result of this change you may 
  need in some cases to rebuild your code with the new cactus jar in the 
  classpath.
* Due to the internal package restructuration, the jspredirector.jsp file 
  was modified. If you have installed this file manually somewhere, you'll 
  need to remember to update it with the new version.
* List of known bugs are available on http://tinyurl.com/3edgv
