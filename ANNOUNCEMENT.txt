The Cactus project is pleased to announce the release of version 1.5.
Cactus is a unit testing framework for testing server side java code.

Please check the Changes page (http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/changes.html)
for a full list of the changes in version 1.5. 

Known limitations or not fixed bugs:

* Support for WebLogic 6.x and 7.x has not been tested.
* [Bug 21484] ClassCastException when casting WebAppRequestDispatcher  
* [Bug 21237] CactifyWarTask duplicates init-param lines in existing web.xml 
  servlet tag  
* [Bug 17933] FormAuthentication assumes "localhost" when adding cookies  
* [Bug 17077] Code page problems under WebSphere z/OS  
* [Bug 17653] result is null in AbstractWebTestCaller's doGetResults() method
  Note that this bug is probably due to a race condition problem that happens
  very unfrequently and which is not yet resolved. It will be solved in an
  upcoming point release.
* Some binary incompatiblity was introduced by the refactoring of the
  XXXTestCase class hierarchy. Whereas it was previously inheriting from 
  AbstractWebTestCase and AbstractTestCase, it is now simply inheriting
  from JUnit TestCase. Thus all non-public API are now not visible from 
  users (as they should be). If you had some framework compiled with Cactus 
  1.4.1 and using some methods from AbstractWebTestCase or 
  AbstractTestCase, you'll need to recompile it with Cactus 1.5 or you 
  might get a NoClassDefFoundError exception. We'll be more careful in the
  future.

Also it should be noted that the Eclipse plugin for Cactus is not part of
Cactus 1.5 as it is still experimental. It is available in Cactus nightly
build area (http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/downloads.html). Your feedback
is important to make it production ready. If you're an Eclipse user, make
sure you try it (it is documented on 
http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/integration/eclipse/index.html).
