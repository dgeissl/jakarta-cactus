This sample application demonstrates how to use Cactus for unit testing
server side java code (Servlet, Taglib and Filters). The goal is to show as
many use cases as possible. You can use this sample to get familiar with
Cactus and also as a starting point for building your own test classes.

In addition, it also shows the following features :
- how to integrate Cactus unit tests with Ant by providing an already made
  Ant build script and several batch/script files.
- how to automatically run the unit tests for a great variety of servlet engines
  (Tomcat 3.2, Tomcat 4.0, Resin 1.2+, Resin 1.3+, Orion 1.4, WebLogic 5.1, ...)
- how to completely automate the running of the unit tests for several servlet
  engines with a single batch/script file and using build listener to report
  errors. This is very useful for continuous integration for example.

For documentation on how to use Cactus, Ant integration, ... see the Cactus
web site at http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus

Note: Before running the ant build file, you'll need to create a
build/build.properties file (a sample one, build/build.properties.sample is
provided that you can copy) and edit it. Then you can type 'ant -projecthelp' to
get the list of available targets.

Thank you.
