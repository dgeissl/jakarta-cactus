    <section name="Current scope and status of Cactus">

      <p>
        Cactus has the ability to unit test the following kind of components
        running in a Servlet/EJB container:
      </p>
      <p class="image">
      <img src="images/scope.jpg" alt="Scope and Status"/>
      </p>
      <note>
        Support for testing the View layer is done through integration
	with <a href="http://httpunit.sourceforge.net/">HttpUnit</a>.
        This is functional unit testing (see the
	<a href="index.html#unittest_types">What is Cactus</a> 
        page, for a description of the different kinds of unit tests).
      </note>
      <note>
        EJB unit testing is currently done by calling the EJB to unit test as 
        you would if you were writing code to call an EJB from a servlet (See
	the <a href="writing/howto_ejb.html">EJB Howto</a> page for more details).
        We are working on providing an EJB Redirector.

    <section name="General design features">

      <ul>
        <li>
          Cactus gives you a very good confidence that your code is going
          to run fine on the server it will be deployed on (thanks to Cactus
          in-container approach that executes the test <em>inside</em> the
          container),
        </li>
        <li>
          Cactus let you test container interactions. This is essential
          in a world where containers are providing more and more
          features for their components every day,
        </li>
        <li>
          Cactus let you test and automate the deployment process to your
          server (using powerful Integration Modules with different build 
          tools and IDEs),
        </li>
        <li>
          Cactus does not mandate any change to your classes to test, although
          it helps think about writing better code and do some refactoring,
        </li>
        <li>
          Cactus provides a good middle ground in term of test granularity:
          too fine-grained tests are hard to write (like Mock Objects tests
          that completely simulates the domain objects and focus exclusively
          on unit testing your code logic) and need complementary tests. Too
          coarse-grained tests (like functional tests) are not enough to
          easily uncover bugs and work in a iterative development process
          where tests are run very often to ensure everything is working. We
          believe Cactus provides a good compromise.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <img src="images/new.jpg" alt="New in Cactus 1.7"/><em> = 
        New in Cactus 1.7</em>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Integrates seamlessly with the JUnit testing framework. Any tool
          that works with JUnit will work with Cactus because a Cactus test
          is a JUnit test! See the
	  <a href="writing/howto_testcase.html">TestCase Howto</a>
          tutorial for details.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provides a <code>ServletTestCase</code> class that your test case
          can extend for unit testing Servlets or any java classes that
          make use of Servlet API objects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provides a <code>JspTestCase</code> class that your test case
          can extend for unit testing Taglibs or any java classes that
          make use of JSP API objects. In addition, provides a
          <code>TestJspTagLifecycle</code> extension to help test JSP Taglibs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provides a <code>FilterTestCase</code> class that your test case
          can extend for unit testing Filters or any java classes that
          make use of Filter API objects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Allows to run existing JUnit Test Case classes on the server side.
          This is provided by special Cactus TestSuite classes that wrap
          your existing Test Cases.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ability to unit test EJBs (including local interfaces) by calling
          them from a <code>ServletTestCase</code>,
          <code>JspTestCase</code> or <code>FilterTestCase</code> class (see 
	  the <a href="writing/howto_ejb.html">EJB Howto</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
          Extends JUnit by defining two additional (and optional) methods
          that can be implemented for each test case (i.e. for each
          <code>testXXX()</code> method): <code>beginXXX()</code> and
          <code>endXXX()</code>. See the
	  <a href="writing/howto_testcase.html">TestCase Howto</a> tutorial
          for details.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is possible to set up the following in <code>beginXXX()</code>:
          <ul>
            <li>
              HTTP cookies,
            </li>
            <li>
              Servlet Session Cookie,
            </li>
            <li>
              HTTP parameters (GET and POST),
            </li>
            <li>
              HTTP Headers,
            </li>
            <li>
              Whether an HTTP Session will be created or not on the server side,
            </li>
            <li>
              BASIC and Form-based Authentication parameters,
            </li>
            <li>
              Send any data as POST data
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          It is possible to verify the following in <code>endXXX()</code>:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Returned data (as String or using <code>HttpUnit</code>),
            </li>
            <li>
              Returned cookies,
            </li>
            <li>
              Returned HTTP headers,
            </li>
            <li>
              Returned response code
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Handles <code>setUp()</code> and <code>tearDown()</code> methods
          which work the same as for JUnit except that they are run on the
          server side before and after calling each <code>testXXX()</code>
          method
        </li>
        <li>
          Extends JUnit by providing a global <code>begin()</code> and
          <code>end()</code> which are run on the client side before and 
          after each test. They are the equivalent of JUnit's 
          <code>setUp()</code> and <code>tearDown()</code> which are run
          on the Server side.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provides several Integration Module for easily running Cactus
          tests:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>Ant Integration Module</em>: generic and directly usable 
              scripts to run Cactus tests (start and stop containers 
              automatically, package and deploy a Cactify webapp and run the 
              tests).
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Browser Integration</em>: It is possible to run Cactus tests
              from a Browser. Results can be displayed either in XML or in
              HTML (either server-side XSLT or Browser XSLT for the Browsers 
              which support it)
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Maven Integration</em>: Complete end to end Cactus test 
              automation with minimal setup. It's probably currently the easiest
              way to run Cactus tests (provided you have Maven installed on
              your machine).
            </li>
            <li>
              Several other integration provided by third parties.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The Ant integration module and the Maven integraton one support the 
          containers that are currently supported by <a href="http://cargo.codehaus.org/">Cargo</a>.More on how to integrate Cactus and Cargo could be found in the <a href="integration/index.html">ingration section</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Tested with all versions of JUnit up to the current one in JUnit SVN.
        </li>
        <li>
          Support for Servlet API 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 (Support for Servlet API 2.1 is
          no longer provided)
        </li>
        <li>
          Works with JDK 1.4+
        </li>
        <li>
          Wraps some of the standard API objects in order to provide
          additional methods to help write unit tests.
	  See the <a href="writing/howto_testcase.html">TestCase
          Howto</a> tutorial for details.
        </li>
        <li>
          Internal logging using Jakarta Commons Logging facade framework
          to help debug problems.
        </li>
        <li>
          HttpUnit integration. See the
	  <a href="writing/howto_httpunit.html">HttpUnit Howto</a> tutorial
          for details. This enables
          Cactus to provide strong and integrated functional
          unit testing features.
        </li>
        <li>
          Uses Jakarta Commons
	  <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/">HttpClient</a> for HTTP
          connections.
        </li>
        <li>
          Support for BASIC and Form-based authentication methods. You can test 
          code that uses the Servlet security API (see the
	  <a href="writing/howto_security.html">Security Howto</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
          Ability to specify, per test case, what redirector to use. Useful,
          for example, when you want to test some code that is using the
          Servlet Security API at the same time as other code that should not
          be protected.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provides a <code>JettyTestSetup</code> JUnit TestSetup class to
          automatically start Jetty before a test suite starts executing.
          (* Jetty integration works with version 5.0 of Jetty)
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide a sample application that demonstrates how to write Cactus
          tests for Servlet, Taglibs and Filters. It also show how to use the 
          Ant Integration Module to automate the full process.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide a sample application that demonstrates how to use the 
          <code>JettyTestSetup</code> feature to run Cactus tests.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide a sample application that demonstrates how to write Cactus
          tests for EJBs. It also show how to use the Ant Integration Module
          to automate the full process.
        </li>
        <li>
          Supports internationalization.
        </li>
