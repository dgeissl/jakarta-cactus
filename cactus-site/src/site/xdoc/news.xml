Christian Sell has started a new framework called
<a href="http://appserverunit.dev.java.net/">AppServerUnit</a>. Its principle seems
very similar to Cactus in that it also uses a server interception approach in order
to run JUnit test cases on the server side. It focuses only on EJB and has some
client side tools to create test-instrumented EARs.
