      <p>
        See the 
        <a href="changes.html#release_changes">Changes</a> 
        page for full list of changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are the changes that might affect your previous installation of
        Cactus 1.3:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Configuring Cactus logging has changed. See the
          <a href="site:howto_config">Config Howto</a> page. Thus, the old
          <code>cactus.enableLogging</code> property no longer has any effect.
        </li>
        <li>
          One new jar needs to be put in both client and server side classpaths:
          <code>commons-logging.jar</code>, due to the new logging system.
        </li>
        <li>
          The following classes have been removed (they were
          deprecated in Cactus 1.2):
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>org.apache.cactus.ServletTestRequest</code>,
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>org.apache.cactus.util.ClientCookie</code>,
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>org.apache.cactus.util.AssertUtils</code>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          External jars provided by Cactus have been renamed to contain their
          version suffixed to their name.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <code>jspRedirector.jsp</code> now creates a HTTP Session by
          default (it was not previously).
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section name="From Cactus 1.2 to 1.3">

      <p>
        Here are the steps to migrate from Cactus 1.2 to 1.3
      </p>

      <note>
        This migration guide does not explain any of the new feature of
        Cactus 1.3 but concentrates on making you move from Cactus 1.2 to 1.3.
      </note>

      <p>
        Let's call <code>CACTUS_HOME</code> the directory where you unzipped
        the Cactus distribution.
      </p>

      <p>
        Follow these steps:
      </p>
      
      <section name="Step 1">

        <p>
          Put <code>aspectjrt.jar</code> (found in
          <code>CACTUS_HOME/lib</code>) in both your client side and server
          side classpaths.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section name="Step 2">

        <p>
          Modify your <code>cactus.properties</code> to the new format. For
          example:
        </p>
<source><![CDATA[
cactus.contextURL = http://localhost:8000/cactus
cactus.servletRedirectorName = ServletRedirector
]]></source>

      </section>

      <section name="Step 3">

        <p>
          Ensure that <code>cactus.servletRedirectorName</code> does not end
          with a "/" and that the mapping in <code>web.xml</code> matches it:
        </p>
<source><![CDATA[
    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>ServletRedirector</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/ServletRedirector</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
]]></source>

      </section>

      <p>
        The Cactus sample is supposed to work with Ant 1.4. However, we
        introduced an incompatibility at the last moment (i.e. a feature only
        supported by Ant 1.5). If you're using Ant 1.4, simply remove the
        failing line (it is an optional line).
