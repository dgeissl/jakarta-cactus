                        The Cactus plugin for Maven, which was previously hosted in Maven
                        CVS itself, has now moved to the Cactus CVS. It will no longer be bundled
                        in the next Maven release. This is part of an effort to decouple Maven plugins
                        from Maven core. There is a new mechanism to easily install external plugins.

                        Transition to a new web site stylesheet that more heavily relies

                        look a bit odd on old browsers like Netscape 4.x, but still should be quite
                        usable.
