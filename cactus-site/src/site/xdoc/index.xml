            <p>
                Cactus is a simple test framework for unit testing server-side java
                code (Servlets, EJBs, Tag Libs, Filters, ...).
            </p>
            <p>
                The intent of Cactus is to lower the cost of writing tests for
                server-side code. It uses <a href="http://junit.org/">JUnit</a> and
                extends it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cactus implements an in-container strategy, meaning that tests are
                executed inside the container.
            </p>

                The Cactus Ecosystem is made of several components:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Cactus Framework: This is the heart of Cactus. It is the engine
                    that provides the API to write Cactus tests.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Cactus Integration Modules: They are front ends and frameworks
                    that provide easy ways of using the Cactus Framework (Ant scripts,
                    Eclipse plugin, Maven plugin, ...).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Cactus Samples: They are simple projects that demonstrate how
                    to write Cactus tests and how to use some of the Integration Modules.

        <section name="Different kinds of unit tests" id="unittest_types">

            <p>
                There are several kinds of unit testing frameworks. We categorize them
                in 3 types:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Type 1: code logic unit testing</strong>. Probably the
                    best strategy for these tests is to use a
                    <a href="http://www.mockobjects.com/">Mock Objects</a>
                    type
                    framework.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Type 2: integration unit testing</strong>. Cactus is
                    typically in this category (we'll let you judge if it is the best or
                    not :)). These tests will exercise the interactions with the
                    container.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Type 3: functional unit testing</strong>. These unit tests
                    will let you test the returned values from your server code. This is
                    for example
                    <a href="http://httpunit.sourceforge.net/">HttpUnit</a>
                    (Note that HttpUnit also
                    performs standard functional testing - as opposed to functional unit
                    testing -, which let you test full use cases - a login use case for
                    example, which is comprised of several requests/responses).
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Ideally you would use 3 different frameworks just to unit test your
                code ! Then you have to think about acceptance testing, system
                integration testing, ...
            </p>
            <p>
                Cactus was developed to fit Type 2 but also to be a very good
                compromise for types 1 and 3, with the idea that it is much easier to
                have to write tests for a single framework than for several ! Moreover,
                you can never fully test your code. We believe Cactus provides a middle
                ground that provides a high confidence that your code will run when
                deployed. However, it is your choice and you can use Cactus only for
                type 2 if you wish.
