                Cactus provides several <code>TestCase</code> classes that extends the
                JUnit <code>Testcase</code> and it also provides several kind of
                redirectors (Servlet Redirector, JSP Redirector, ...). The diagram
                above is a generic diagram which serves to explain the principles.
                You'll find details for a specific redirector proxy in the next
                section.

            <p>
                Let's go through the different steps to understand how it works. Here
                is what happens for each <code>testXXX()</code> method in your
                test case class (derived from <code>YYYTestCase</code>):
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The JUnit Test Runner calls a
                    <code>YYYTestCase.runTest()</code>
                    method. This method first looks for a
                    <code>begin(WebRequest)</code>
                    method and executes it if found. Note that this method is called
                    before each test. The <code>WebRequest</code> parameter passed to
                    the <code>beginXXX()</code> method is used to set the HTTP headers,
                    the HTTP parameters, ... that will be sent in step 2 to the Redirector
                    proxy. The <code>runTest()</code> method then looks for a
                    <code>beginXXX(WebRequest)</code>
                    method and executes it if
                    found.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>YYYTestCase.runTest()</code> method then opens an HTTP
                    connection to the Redirector proxy. All the parameters set up
                    in the <code>beginXXX()</code> method are sent in the HTTP request
                    (HTTP headers, HTTP parameters, ...)
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Redirector proxy acts as a proxy on the server side for your
                    test case class. It means that your test case class is instantiated
                    twice: once on the client side (by the JUnit Test Runner) and once
                    on the server side (by the Redirector proxy). The client side
                    instance is used for executing the
                    <code>begin()</code>, <code>beginXXX()</code>,
                    <code>endXXX()</code>
                    and <code>end()</code> methods (see
                    steps 1 and 8) and the server side instance is used for executing
                    the <code>testXXX()</code> methods (see step 4). The Redirector
                    proxy does the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            creates an instance of your test class using reflection. It
                            then sets specific implicit objects (which are class
                            variables of <code>YYYTestCase</code>). These implicit objects
                            depend on the redirector proxy (see next section).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            creates instances of Cactus wrappers for some server objects
                            (<code>HttpServletRequest</code>, <code>ServletConfig</code>,
                            <code>ServletContext</code>, ...). This is to be able to
                            to override some methods in order to return simulated values.
                            For example, the Cactus framework can simulate an URI (i.e.
                            act as if this URI was called instead of the Redirector proxy
                            URI). Thus, the <code>getServerName()</code>,
                            <code>getServerPort()</code>,
                            <code>getRequestURI()</code>, ... methods return values based
                            on the simulated URI (if there is any defined by the user).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            creates an HTTP Session if the user has expressed the wish
                            (using the
                            <code>WebRequest.setAutomaticSession(boolean)</code>
                            code in the <code>beginXXX()</code> method. By default a session
                            is always created) and the redirector fills by reflection the
                            <code>session</code>
                            implicit object.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>setUp()</code>,
                    <code>testXXX()</code>
                    and <code>tearDown()</code> methods of your test class are executed
                    (in that order). They are called by the Redirector proxy using
                    reflection. Of course, <code>setUp()</code> and
                    <code>tearDown()</code>
                    are optional (same as in JUnit).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your <code>testXXX()</code> method calls your server
                    side code to test, executing the test and using the JUnit assert API
                    to assert the result (<code>assert()</code>,
                    <code>assertEquals()</code>, <code>fail()</code>, ...)
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the test fails, your <code>testXXX()</code> methods
                    throws exceptions which are caught by the Redirector proxy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If an exception has been raised, the Redirector proxy returns the
                    information about the exception (its name, class, stack trace) back
                    to the client side. Information about the exception will then be
                    printed by JUnit in its Test Runner console.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If no exception occurred, the
                    <code>YYYTestCase.runTest()</code>
                    method looks for an
                    <code>endXXX(org.apache.cactus.WebResponse)</code>
                    or <code>endXXX(com.meterware.httpunit.WebResponse)</code> method (this
                    signature is used for <a href="writing/howto_httpunit.html">HttpUnit
                    integration</a>) and executes it if found. At this stage,
                    you have the opportunity to check returned HTTP headers, Cookies and
                    the servlet output stream in the <code>endXXX()</code> method, again
                    using JUnit asserts and helper utility classes provided by Cactus.
                    Then the <code>runTest()</code> methods looks for an
                    <code>end(org.apache.cactus.WebResponse)</code>
                    or
                    <code>end(com.meterware.httpunit.WebResponse)</code>
                    method and calls
                    it if found. This <code>end()</code> method is called after each test.
                </li>
            </ol>

                    Cactus provides 3 implementations of Redirector Proxies
                    (see the

                        should be used for unit testing servlet methods or any java class
                        that uses servlet objects (<code>HttpServletRequest</code>, ...)

                    <li>

                        should be used for unit testing server code that need access to
                        JSP implicit objects (<code>PageContext</code>, ...). The JSP
                        Redirector should be used to unit test custom Tag libraries.

                        <em>A Filter Redirector</em>. This redirector is a Servlet Filter
                        that should be uses for unit testing Servlet Filters or any java
                        class that uses filter objects (<code>FilterConfig</code>, ...).
