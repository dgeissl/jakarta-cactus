                This tutorial explains how to build Cactus from SVN or from a source
                download.

                If you just want to use Cactus, it will be easier to simply download
                a <a href="../downloads.html">nightly build</a> (if you need the
                latest and greatest), or the latest
                <a href="../downloads.html">stable release</a>

        <section name="Getting the Source">
            <p>
                There are two ways to obtain the source code for Cactus: either
                directly from SVN, or by downloading a prepackaged source archive.
            </p>

            <subsection name="SVN">
                <p>
                    To get the current development version of the Cactus source code,
                    you'll need to download the source from SVN. To do this, you'll need
                    to have a SVN client installed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Detailed instructions about accessing the Apache SVN repository can
                    be found
                    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/cvsindex.html">here</a>.
                </p>
            </subsection>

            <subsection name="Prepackaged Source Archives">
                <p>
                    If you don't have access to the Apache SVN repository (because you're
                    behind a firewall, for example), or you don't need to be absolutely
                    up to date, you can download an archive containing a snapshot of the
                    Cactus code base.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Such archives are made available for each release as well as for the
                    nightly builds. Go <a href="https://dgeissl.github.io/jakarta-cactus/downloads.html">here</a> to find out
                    about the download locations.

                The following sections list java libraries that you need to have
                present in your local filesystem for the build.
                <strong>Do not worry!</strong>
                We won't ask you to fish around to
                get these libraries :-)
                The Maven2 build system does this automatically. The
                next section on
                <a href="#build">Performing Builds</a>
                explains how to use it.

                    2.0.4 (or later) installed. For building the samples module you'll need to have

                    1.6.5 (or later) installed.

                <p>
                    You'll need to have the following libraries put in your
                    <code>[ANT_HOME]/lib/</code>
                    directory.

                    In addition, Cactus depends on a number of additional external
                    libraries at build time. The Maven2 build system will download
                    automatically these dependencies in the local repository.

            <p>
                Good news: it should be extremely easy to build Cactus from the
                sources! :-) After ensuring that you connected to internet, type the
                following command one after another:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        <code>mvn clean install</code>
                    </strong>
                    : This will
                    automatically download all the required dependencies. It takes about
                    7 minutes on a 512 kbps internet connection the first time. If you're
                    behind a firewall, you'll need to read this <a
                        href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html">tutorial
                </a> for specifying a proxy.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The build result will be located in the <code>[USER_HOME]/.m2/repository/io/github/dgeissl/cactus/</code> directory.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="info infomark">
                Some projects depend on others and thus you may need to run the build
                for those projects first. For example, the servlet sample depends on
                the framework and the Ant integration, so these will need to be built
                before the servlet sample is built. To avoid these problems you can
                simply type <code>mvn install</code> at the top level as it builds the
                different projects in the correct order.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Before creating a patch, and especially before committing changes, be
                sure to run both the <em>checkstyle</em> and <em>test</em> plugins of
                the corresponding module. Often we will also need to run the servlet
                sample tests, because they effectively represent the regression test
                suite for Cactus. You might want to simply perform a full rebuild to
                be sure that nothing has been negatively affected by your changes.

        <section name="Create the Cactus Archives From Source">

            <p>
                So after you have checked out the source of Cactus there is
                one more step to make in order to get the assemblies. First,
                as usual, ensure that you are connected to the internet. After
                that go to the top-folder of the Cactus check-out and
                follow these steps.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In order to make the archives you need to prepare the content
                    for the archives. First package all the jars with:
                    <strong>
                        <code>mvn clean package</code>
                    </strong>
                    :
                    This will make all of the submodules to package their jars.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        <code>mvn assembly:assembly -N</code>
                    </strong>
                    : This will
                    automatically start making the assemblies, and once the download
                    of all of the required dependencies is finished you will see a
                    <code>target/</code>
                    folder in the top-level folder. This folder will contain the
                    assemblies for the Cactus project.

        <section name="Generating the Cactus web-site.">

            <p>
                If you want to generate the Cactus web-site, this is what you
                should do:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Navigate to the top-folder of the Cactus check-out and generate
                    the javadoc:
                    <br/>
                    <strong>
                        <code>mvn javadoc:javadoc</code>
                    </strong>
                    <br/>
                    and XRef:
                    <br/>
                    <strong>
                        <code>mvn jxr:jxr</code>
                    </strong>
                    <br/>
                    contents of the web-site. These two line will generate the reports in the
                    <strong>
                        <code>cactus-site/src/site/resources/</code>
                    </strong>
                    folder.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After that navigate to the cactus-site submodule:
                    <br/>
                    <strong>
                        <code>cd cactus-site/</code>
                    </strong>
                    <br/>
                    and execute the following:
                    <br/>
                    <strong>
                        <code>mvn site:site</code>
                    </strong>
                    <br/>
                    As a result you will have the Cactus web-site generated in the
                    <strong>
                        <code>[CACTUS_ROOT]/cactus-site/target/site</code>
