        <section name="Farewell to Nicolas Chalumeau">

            <p>
                Our friend Nicolas Chalumeau has departed this world on the 4th of
                October 2005 at the age of 27.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Apache Software Foundation would like to express its condolences
                to Nicolas' family and friends.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nicolas had been developing open source software at Apache for
                several years. He was participating in several projects including
                Jakarta Cactus and Apache Maven. But even more importantly than
                helping those projects, what made Nicolas stand apart was his kindness
                and his generosity. He was always open to discussion and was
                constantly helping others. On the Cactus project he was regularly the
                first to answer questions from newcomers trying to use Cactus.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently he had taken up the important task of helping migrate Cactus
                to use Cargo and he had been working diligently towards that task.
                Actually Nicolas had been doing such a great job on the Cactus project
                that the Cactus committers had unanimously voted him in to become a
                committer. Nicolas was voted an Apache committer on the 1st of August
                2005. I had several discussions with Nicolas about this new role and
                he was extremely happy to be part of the Apache Foundation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nicolas, we'll miss you, but the work you have done for the community
                will be remembered forever and will live on. All our thoughts and good
                wishes are with you and your loved ones.
            </p>
            <p>
                -Vincent on behalf of the Apache community
            </p>
