        <section name="Why Cactus?">

            <p>
                Here are some stories and reasons about the 'Cactus' name:)
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    It's a cool name ... Short, easy to pronounce, same meanings in all
                    spoken languages, has some punch ...
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is a famous french song by Jacques Dutronc about cacti that
                    goes "le monde entier est un cactus ..." (the whole world is a
                    Cactus). The lyrics is available
                    <a href="http://www.frmusique.ru/texts/d/dutronc_jacques/cactus.htm">here
                    </a>
                    and the music (midi format)
                    <a href="http://membres.lycos.fr/nabla007/musique/jacques_dutronc_(les_cactus).mid">here
                    </a>. It is a
                    song that says that cacti are everywhere and that everything is
                    a cactus. I like that ! :) ...
                </li>
                <li>
                    The J2EEUnit name (which was the previous name of Cactus) was fine
                    but there was a Sun trademark on the J2EE part of the name ...
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cactus is actually an acronym ... ha ha .. for Computer Assisted
                    Construction of Test Units for the Server, or Cool and Comprehensive
                    Test Units for the Server, or ... (please send your suggestions to
                    the <a href="mail-lists.html">Cactus mailing list</a>).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The company for which I worked (
                    <a href="http://www.octo.com/">OCTO Technology</a>) had organized a diner
                    to celebrate our 3 years of existence. I was looking for a new name
                    for J2EEUnit. I asked some workmates to help me look for a name. We
                    tried to find a name which had something to do with the Apache name.
                    We thought of indians of course ... we tried several names and then
                    Dominique said "Cactus" (you know, indians, the desert, cacti.
                    That's one cliche of indians we have here in France !). I immediatly
                    liked it ...
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Cactus name has a rich visual iconography associated with it. So
                    it should be possible to find a nice and funny logo (I'm still
                    looking for the perfect logo ... If you have propositions, you can
                    send them to the <a href="mail-lists.html">Cactus mailing list
                </a> (there is currently a <a href="participating/logos.html">logo contest
                </a> going on ! Try defeating the current logo if you think you
                    can do better !).
                </li>
                <li>
                    A Cactus is full of spines. Visually you can imagine that a piece of
                    code that has gone through this rigourous and comprehensive testing
                    has had all its bug revealed ! ...
                </li>
                <li>
                    We can imagine a motto like "Tested on Apache-Cactus" !
                </li>

                    In Australia it is a widely used phrase that refers to something
                    that it not functioning correctly. So the name 'Cactus' is a very
                    appropriate name for a testing tool. See
                    the <a href="http://www.koalanet.com.au/australian-slang.html">Australian Slang</a> page.

                    Any more...?
