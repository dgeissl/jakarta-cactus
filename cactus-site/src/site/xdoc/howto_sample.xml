      <p>
        This tutorial explains where to get Cactus samples and how to use
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some samples available as part of the documentation. The
        samples depend on the kind of test case you are writing (Servlet,
        Taglibs, Filters, ...). For this reason you'll find some samples
        in the <a href="writing/howto_testcase.html">TestCase Howto</a>
        tutorial.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the majority of Cactus samples are in the form of source
        samples. These samples are part of the Cactus distribution that
        you have downloaded (in the <code>samples</code> directory).
      </p>
      <p>
        The following section explains how to execute the Cactus Samples
        using Ant or Maven2(the Maven2 execution only calls the Ant execution).
        If you wish to integrate them in your own build system or in your
        favorite IDE, you'll have to understand the principles first and
        manually install them (read the
        <a href="getting_started.html">Getting Started</a>
        and the <a href="integration/manual/howto_config.html">Configuration Howto</a>
        tutorials). Some detailed explanations for IDE integration
        are also available in the <a href="integration/howto_ide.html">IDE Howto</a>
        tutorial.

      <subsection name="Prerequisites">

        <p>
          You need to install the following items prior to building the Cactus
          Sample application:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A JVM (1.2 or above),
          </li>
          <li>
            You don't need a servlet engine any more, since Cactus in integrated with
            Cargo and now Cargo tries to download a servlet container for you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ant (see the <a href="integration/ant/howto_ant_install.html">"Installing
            Ant"</a> tutorial).
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="http://ant.apache.org/ivy/">Ivy</a> for copying the dependencies from the <code>m2</code> repository.
            The installation of Ivy is pretty straight-forward: simply place the two <code>Ivy</code>
            jars(<code>ivy-[version].jar</code> and <code>ivy-core[version].jar</code>) in the <code>ANT_HOME/lib</code> directory. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven2</a> for getting the dependencies.        
          </li>
          
        </ul>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Installing the Cactus Sample">

        <p>
          Follow these steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Download the <a href="downloads.html">Cactus Sample</a> and
            unzip it in a directory. Let's call the <code>[downloaded_directory]/samples</code> directory
            <em><code>sampleroot</code></em>.
          </li>
        </ul>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Running the samples">

        <p>
          Open a shell, cd to the <em><code>sampleroot</code></em>
          directory and select which samples you want to run. To run all of the
          dependencies type in <code>sampleroot</code> the following: <code>mvn install</code>.
          If you want to run just one type of samples, cd to the corresponding directory and
          type agsain <code>mvn install</code>. What will happen is that Maven will get all of the
          dependencies(approximately 10-15 min.) and then will invoke Ant to execute the tests.
          Ant will call Cargo to get the container that is needed to execute the tests in (approximately 5-10 min.)
          and will execute the tests (approximately 2-3 mins.) As you can see the majority of time
          is spent on getting the dependencies and the containers. Hopefully this is done only one time(dependencies)
          or until you call <code>mvn clean</code>(containers).
