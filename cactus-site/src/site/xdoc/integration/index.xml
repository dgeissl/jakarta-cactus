        <section name="Starting Cactus tests">

            <p>
                The Cactus tests are started using a JUnit Test Runner. There are
                several integration clients you can use for executing these test runners:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="manual/index.html">Manually</a>. This means
                    that you need to deploy your code and tests into your container and
                    start this container by yourself. Then you can execute the tests
                    by running a standard JUnit test Runner. For example, you can start
                    the tests:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            From the java command line, calling the
                            <code>main()</code>
                            method of a JUnit Test Runner. For example, running the JUnit
                            Swing Test Runner:
                            <code>junit.swingui.TestRunner.main [test case class]</code>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="howto_ide.html">From an IDE</a>
                            or any tool
                            providing a JUnit integration plugin.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="integration_browser.html">From a browser</a>, by
                            using the Cactus Servlet Test Runner, which is a special JUnit
                            Test Runner. Please also check the
                            <a href="howto_tomcat.html">Tomcat quick start tutorial</a>
                            which is a step by step tutorial describing how to deploy Cactus
                            tests in Tomcat and how to execute them through a browser.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            From Ant by simply using the <code>&lt;junit&gt;</code> Ant task
                            found in the Ant distribution.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using the Cactus <a href="ant/index.html">Ant
                    integration</a>. Cactus provides several custom Ant task to
                    automate the deployment of Cactus tests
                    (<code>&lt;cactifywar&gt;</code>) and the
                    start/stop/configuration of your container
                    (<code>&lt;cactus&gt;</code>). Note that you can also use the
                    custom <code>&lt;runservertests&gt;</code> Ant task which allows you
                    to use your existing container configuration should you wish to.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using the Cactus <a href="maven/index.html">Maven
                    plugin</a>. As with the Ant tasks this plugin offers a fully
                    automated solution to deploy and execute Cactus tests.
