      	Lists of todos and ideas for future versions.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Refactor code in goals cactus:test, cactus:single, cactus:match
          and cactus:test-ear to share more code. Currently there is a lot 
          of cut-n-paste code. Should use jelly tags to reuse code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add support for Jetty (note: This should actually be added in the
          Cactus/Ant integration module and not in the Maven plugin), for
          better reuse.
