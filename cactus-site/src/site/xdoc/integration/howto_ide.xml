            <p>
                In order to simplify Cactus integration within your IDE (i.e. running
                the Cactus tests from your IDE), we have
                provided several tutorial detailing the involved steps for several
                IDEs:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="howto_ide_jbuilder4.html">JBuilder Integration
                        Tutorial
                    </a>
                    (more focused on JBuilder 4),
                </li>
                <li>
                    Another <a href="howto_ide_jbuilder5.html">JBuilder Integration
                    Tutorial
                </a> (more focused on JBuilder 5),
                </li>
                <li>
                    VisualAge for Java Integration:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <a href="howto_ide_vajava_wte.html">VAJava and integrated WebSphere Test
                                Environment (WTE)
                            </a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="howto_ide_vajava_tomcat.html">VAJava and Tomcat Test Environment</a>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                If your favorite IDE is not listed there, don't despair ! It is
                actually very simple to integrate Cactus within your
                environment. You simply need to know how to start your servlet engine
                from your IDE (possibly in debug mode if you wish to debug your
                test case) and set up correctly the class path (see the
                <a href="manual/howto_classpath.html">Classpath Howto</a>
                tutorial
                for understanding the classpath). Look at the tutorials for other IDEs
                and do the same for yours.
