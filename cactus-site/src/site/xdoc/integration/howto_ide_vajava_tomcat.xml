                This tutorial explains how to run Cactus tests within VisualAge for
                Java Tomcat Test Environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following tutorial has been tested with VisualAge 3.5.3 and Apache
                Tomcat Test Environment 3.1. Please tell us if you find that it works
                with other versions.
            </p>

                Let's call
                <strong>
                    <code>{VAJava dir}</code>
                </strong>
                the directory
                where VAJava is installed. Let's also suppose that the context of our
                webapp is called
                <strong>
                    <code>myApp</code>
                </strong>
                .
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Import Cactus and JUnit into VisualAge as projects,
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the Cactus redirector mappings to your web.xml file (see the
                    <a href="manual/howto_config.html">Configuration Howto</a>), which is
                    located at
                    <code>{VAJava
                        dir}\ide\project_resources\Apache_Tomcat_Test_Environment\webapps\myApp\WEB-INF\</code>,
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make sure the <code>cactus.properties</code> file has the correct
                    URL for the redirectors (see the
                    <a href="manual/howto_config.html">Configuration Howto</a>). Put the
                    file in
                    <code>{VAJava
                        dir}\ide\project_resources\Apache_Tomcat_Test_Environment\webapps\myApp\WEB-INF\</code>,
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the following directories to JUnit's TestRunner project classpath
                    (project's properties dialog box):
                </li>
            </ul>
            <source><![CDATA[
{VAJava dir}\ide\project_resources\Apache_Tomcat_Test_Environment\webapps\myApp\WEB-INF\;
{VAJava dir}\ide\project_resources\Apache_Tomcat_Test_Environment\webapps\myApp\WEB-INF\classes\;
]]></source>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Add the Cactus project to both JUnit's TestRunner and Apache's
                    TomcatRunner project classpath (project properties dialog boxes).
                </li>
            </ul>
