                <strong>
                    The Eclipse plugin is a work in progress. In the past it was working, but
                    since we moved to the new Ant integration it has been broken. This
                    requires a rewrite of the plugin code to fix. In the meantime, we have
                    removed the plugin download. Sorry about that. Any help will be much
                    welcome.
