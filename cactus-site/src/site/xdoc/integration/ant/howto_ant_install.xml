                This tutorial explains how to install Ant properly to be able to
                run the Sample application provided with the Cactus distribution and
                also build the Cactus distribution from the sources.

        <section name="Ant tasks needed by Cactus">

            <p>
                Cactus uses the following optional tasks of Ant:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The
                    <strong>
                        <code>junit</code>
                    </strong>
                    task: it is used to run
                    the unit tests of Cactus itself and the Cactus unit tests of the
                    Sample application. This task is
                    normally found in the <code>optional.jar</code> Ant jar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Cactus Sample application uses some Ant custom tasks provided
                    by Cactus in the <code>cactus-ant.jar</code> jar file (
                    found in the <code>lib/</code> directory where you unpacked the
                    Cactus distribution).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The
                    <strong>
                        <code>checkstyle</code>
                    </strong>
                    task: it is used only
                    to build Cactus from the sources (i.e. not needed for building the
                    Cactus sample application). The version of
                    <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle</a>
                    used is 3.0+.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                In order to simplify the installation of Ant and the gathering of
                the required Ant tasks as described above, we provide a
                prepackaged zip containing everything needed. This is available from
                the <a href="../../downloads.html">downloads</a> section.

        <section name="Installing Ant on Windows systems">

            <p>
                Follow the steps below to install Ant:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Download Jakarta Ant
                    (<code>jakarta-ant-&lt;version&gt;-bin.zip</code>) from
                    <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">here</a>. We recommend version 1.5.3 or
                    above. Alternatively you can download the
                    prepackaged Ant version, as mentioned above.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Unzip it in a directory. Let's call this directory
                    <code>antroot</code>,
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create an environment variable named <code>ANT_HOME</code> that
                    points to the <code>antroot</code> directory,
                </li>
                <li>
                    Modify the <code>PATH</code> environment variable to include the
                    <code>%ANT_HOME%\bin</code>
                    directory (so that you'll be able to type
                    <code>ant</code>
                    in a DOS shell, in whatever directory and it will
                    call the <code>%ANT_HOME%\bin\ant.bat</code> script,
                </li>
                <li>
                    Download the Ant optional task jar
                    (<code>jakarta-ant-&lt;version&gt;-optional.jar</code>) from
                    <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">here</a>
                    and put it in <code>%ANT_HOME%\lib</code>. <em>Note that this step
                    is needed only if you haven't downloaded the prepackaged zip</em>,
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you haven't downloaded the prepackaged Ant zip, you'll need to
                    download the Stylebook 1.0b3 for Xalan 2 jar, the latest
                    <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/ ">Xalan</a>, the latest
                    <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-j">Xerces</a>, the
                    latest <a href="http://junit.org/">JUnit</a> and the latest
                    <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle</a>
                    jars. You'll
                    also need to ensure that you use a JAXP 1.1 parser. You can download
                    one (crimson) from
                    <a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/download.html">here</a>. Put
                    all these jars in <code>%ANT_HOME%\lib</code>.
                </li>
            </ol>
