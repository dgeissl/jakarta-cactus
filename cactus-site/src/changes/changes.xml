          Add attribute jvmArgs in the container tasks.

          The &lt;resin3x&gt; element of the 
          &lt;cactus&gt;> task is now correctly using the

          The Cactus Servlet Test Runner now re-initializes the Cactus 
          configuration when it is called the first time (in its

          in the same JVM (i.e without restarting the container).
        </action>
        <action dev="VMA" type="add" issue="CACTUS-119">
          The &lt;jboss3x&gt; container element now supports 
          running JBoss in a temporary directory, specified by the 
          tmpdir attribute. In addition, by using the
          configDir attribute, you can now specify a
          directory where you have stored a custom JBoss server configuration
          (identified by the config attribute).
          This configuration will be copied to the tmp directory and used
          to configure JBoss.

          "localhost"" error that was happening when using the 
          &lt;cactus&gt; task with JBoss 3.0.8. It was due to the fact that 
          JBoss 3.0.8 does not support the new --server parameter 
          which works with newer versions of JBoss 3.x
        </action>

          Building Cactus from the sources now requires Ant 1.6.1+ (Ant 1.6.2
          if you're using JDK 5). The Cactus build also been simplified a lot 
          and external libraries are automatically downloaded from ibiblio.org 
          if not present on the file system.

          one.
        </action>  
        <action dev="VMA" type="update" issue="CACTUS-118">
          The JettyTestSetup class now checks if the Jetty server
          is already started and only starts it if it isn't running. It also
          does not stops it if it was running before JettyTestSetup
          was called. This is useful when you have a master test suite and when
          you also wish to run your tests one by one.

        <action dev="VMA" type="fix" issue="CACTUS-107">
          An error was introduced in the Servlet Test Runner during the 
          internal package refactoring that happened in Cactus 1.6. The
          XMLTransformer could not be loaded and it resulted

          The ServletTestRunner now looks for am optional

          Cactus redirectors and for their mappings.
        </action>
        <action dev="VMA" type="update">
          Updated web site documentation for enabling Cactus logging.
        </action>
        <action dev="VMA" type="update">
          Due to some internal package restructuration (all non public API were
          moved to internal packages), the 
          jspredirector.jsp file was modified. If you have 
          installed this file manually somewhere, you'll need to remember to 
          update it.
        </action>
        <action dev="VMA" type="update">
          Big internal restructuration: we have moved all the non public API 
          classes to java packages with the name internal. For
          example the package org.apache.cactus.internal is a 
          package containing some internal implementation. You should not use
          any internal class in your own development as these classes may 
          change at any time in the future. If you find you need access to some
          internal class, please send an email to the Cactus mailing class
          explaining the reason and we may open up some API/SPI.

        <action dev="VMA" type="remove">
          Removed org.apache.cactus.util.HttpURLConnection class.
          It was a Commons HttpClient wrapper on top of the 
          java.net.HttpURLConnection class. However, this class is
          now fully integrated in the Commons HttpClient jar.
        </action>
        <action dev="VMA" type="add">
          Added new optional nested &lt;containerclasspath&gt; 
          element for the &lt;cactus&gt; task. It allows 
          specifying additional jars that will be put in the classpath used to 
          start/stop the specified containers.
        </action>
        <action dev="VMA" type="remove">
          Removed ability to choose different HTTP connection helpers. The only
          one supported now is the Commons HttpClient one provided internally
          by Cactus. Thus the cactus.connectionHelper.classname
          property is now removed.
        </action>
        <action dev="VMA" type="remove">

        Refactored internal code to be able to use different HTTP connection
        implementation. 2 are currently provided: one using the JDK
        HttpURLConnection and one using Jakarta
        <link href="ext:commons_httpclient">Commons HttpClient</link> (the 
        default one). It can be modified by setting the following System
        property: cactus.connectionHelper.classname =
        org.apache.cactus.client.JdkConnectionHelper (for the JDK

        Cactus now requires the Commons Logging library
        (commons-logging.jar). It is needed as Commons HttpClient
        is now using Commons Logging for logging and Cactus depends on
        HttpClient. Cactus is also now using Commons HttpClient for all its
        internal logs. This lets us use any underlying logging implementation:
        Log4j, LogKit, JDK 1.4 Logging, No Logging or SimpleLog (provided with
        Commons Logging - logs to the console). Check the
        <link href="site:howto_config">Config Howto</link> for how
        to configure logging in Cactus.

        Renamed all external jars used in Cactus by suffixing them with their
        versions. This is so that Cactus users will know exactly what jars
        Cactus is packaging. You are of course free to use your own jars and
        Cactus only packages these jars for your convenience. Cactus nows
        packages Log4j 1.2.3, AspectJ Runtime 1.0.4, JUnit 3.7,
        HttpClient 2.0alpha1 built on 6/6/2002, HttpUnit 1.4 and (new) the
