Building the project
====================

Cactus uses Maven 3 as the build mechanism.

Requirements:
(as of Travis CI we are not able to build against older versions)
- Java 1.6 or later
- Maven 3.2.x

Creating the jars
=================

mvn clean install

Running tests
=============

mvn test

Creating the site documentation
===============================

cd top-level

mvn jxr:aggregate
mvn javadoc:javadoc

cd cactus-site
mvn site:site

Creating the distribution
=========================

Ensure that you have created the site first and the jars

change to cactus-assembly directory

mvn assembly:single
