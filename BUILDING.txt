Building the project
====================

Cactus uses Maven 3 as the build mechanism.

Requirements:
(as of Travis CI we are not able to build against older versions)
- Java 1.7 or later

Creating the jars
=================

mvnw clean install

Creating the site documentation
===============================

cd top-level

mvnw jxr:aggregate
mvnw javadoc:javadoc

cd cactus-site
../mvnw site

to deploy the documentation to gh-pages:

mvnw site-deploy

Creating the distribution
=========================

Ensure that you have created the site first and the jars

change to cactus-assembly directory

mvnw assembly:single
