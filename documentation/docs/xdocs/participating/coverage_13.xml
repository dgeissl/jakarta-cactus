      <p>
        These are test coverage reports for Cactus. They were generated using
        <link href="ext:clover">Clover</link>.
        They show how good (or how bad) the Cactus tests suite is.

        Some comments on the results:

      <ul>
        <li>
          Cactus uses AspectJ and thus the coverage report is run on the
          code as modified by AspectJ. This explains why code formatting is
          less than perfect and why you may notice some strange method names
          (they are introduced by AspectJ).
