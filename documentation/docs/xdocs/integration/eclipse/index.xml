  <body>
    <section title="Overview">

      <note><strong>
        The Eclipse plugin is a work in progress. In the past it was working, but
        since we moved to the new Ant integration it has been broken. This 
        requires a rewrite of the plugin code to fix. In the meantime, we have
        removed the plugin download. Sorry about that. Any help will be much
        welcome.
      </strong></note>

      <p>
        The integration of Cactus in the 
        <link href="ext:eclipse">Eclipse</link> platform relies on 2 separate plug-ins :
      </p>
      <li>
        The <link href="site:integration_eclipse_runner">Cactus runner 
        plug-in</link>
      </li>
      <li>
        The <link href="site:integration_eclipse_webapp">Webapp Eclipse 
        plug-in</link>
      </li>
