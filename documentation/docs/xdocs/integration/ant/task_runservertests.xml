  <section title="RunServerTests Task">

    <p>
      The <strong>runservertests</strong> task provides support for starting up
      a servlet container to run in-container tests, and shutting it down again
      after the tests have completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This task will perform several actions, in the following order:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Check if a server is already started by constantly trying to
        call the test URL defined by the <code>testurl</code> attribute.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a server is not running, call the Ant target defined by the
        <code>starttarget</code> attribute. This target is supposed to start 
        your container. The <strong>runservertests</strong> task will then
        constantly poll the server by calling the test URL until the server
        answers back.
      </li>
      <li>
        It will then call the Ant target defined by the <code>testtarget</code>
        attribute. This target is supposed to run the unit tests. This is
        usually implemented by using the Ant <code>junit</code> task.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the tests are finished (i.e. when the
        <code>testtarget</code> has finished executing), it will then
        call the Ant target defined by the <code>stoptarget</code> attribute.
        This target is supposed to stop the container. The
        <strong>runservertests</strong> task will then constantly poll the
        server by calling the test URL until the server stops answering, at
        which point it will consider the server to be stopped. Note that the
        <code>stoptarget</code> will only get called if the server was not
        already started when the <strong>runservertests</strong> task began
        executing. This is to allow keeping running servers for intensive
        debugging phases.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The <strong>runservertests</strong> task is generic in the sense that you
      are free to define the <code>starttarget</code>, <code>testtarget</code>
      and <code>stoptarget</code> as you wish and they will get called at the
      right time.
    </p>

    <note>
      Since Ant 1.5, the effects of this task can also be achieved by using a
      combination of the built-in Ant tasks <code>waitfor</code> (with the 
      <code>http</code> condition), <code>parallel</code>, 
      <code>sequential</code> and <code>antcall</code>.

          <td>
            The target that is called once the server is running. This target

    <section title="Examples">

      <p>
        In the following example, the target <code>start.tomcat.40</code> will
        be called if the specified test URL is not available. After the server
        has started up so that requests to the test URL return successful HTTP
        status codes, the target <code>test</code> is called. Finally, after the
        <code>test</code> target has completed, the target
        <code>stop.tomcat.40</code> is called to shut down the servlet
        container.
