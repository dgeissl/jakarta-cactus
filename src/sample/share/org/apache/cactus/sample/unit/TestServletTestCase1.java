/**
 * Cactus unit tests for testing exception handling of
 * <code>ServletTestCase</code>.
 *
 * These tests should not really be part of the sample application functional
 * tests as they are unit tests for Cactus. However, they are unit tests that
 * need a servlet environment running for their execution, so they have been
 * package here for convenience. They can also be read by end-users to
 * understand how Cactus work.
 * <br><br>
 * Note : This class extends
 * <code>TestServletTestCase1_InterceptorServletTestCase</code> (which itself
 * extends <code>ServletTestCase</code>) because we need to be able to verify
 * exception handling in our unit test cases so we must not let these exceptions
 * get through to JUnit (otherwise the test will appear as failed).
