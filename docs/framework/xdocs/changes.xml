        Cactus now supports JDK 1.4. Actually the only change made to support it
        was to use the <code>assertXXX()</code> methods of JUnit instead of
        the <code>assert()</code> one, which is now a reserved keyword in
        JDK 1.4.

      <action dev="VMA" type="add">
        Added <code>WebRequest.setRedirectorName(String redirectorName)</code>
        to override default <code>cactus.servletRedirectorName</code> parameter
        that you define in <code>cactus.properties</code>. This lets you
        define a redirector per test case if you wish. It is useful when you
        want to test some servlet methods that are secured and others that are
        not, for example.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="update">
        Modified <code>cactus.properties</code> configuration parameters. For
        example, where you previously were writing
        <code>cactus.servletRedirectorURL = http://localhost:8080/test/ServletRedirector</code>
        you would now have 2 parameters :
        <code>cactus.contextURL = http://localhost:8080/test</code> and
        <code>cactus.servletRedirectorName = ServletRedirector</code>.

        Cactus is now working again with JDK 1.2. However, be aware that most
        versions of new Servlet containers need JDK 1.3 and above.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="add">
        Added LICENSE file to all Cactus jars, in <code>META-INF/</code>
        directory.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="fix" due-to="Larry Isaacs" due-to-email="Larry.Isaacs@sas.com">
        Improved Tomcat 3.3 configuration that is bundled with the Cactus
        sample application and added <code>delaySocketClose="true"</code>,
        which is a new attribute of Tomcat 3.3.1. The reason is that on fast
        CPU Tomcat 3.3.0 is releasing too quickly opened sockets and the Cactus
        client side gets a "socket closed by peer" exception.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="add">
        Added automatic script support for WebLogic 6.1.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="fix">
        Corrected bug in
        <code>AbstractHttpServletRequestWrapper.getPathTranslated()</code> which
        was not returning <code>null</code> when <code>getRealPath("/")</code>
        was returning <code>null</code>. It is allowed by the spec. to return
        <code>null</code> upon certain conditions (see section SRV.4.5 of the
        Servlet 2.3 spec.).

        Add a tutorial for setting up Cactus in VAJava with Tomcat environment.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="fix" due-to="Piyush Asthana" due-to-email="piyush.asthana@patni.com">
        Compatibility with JDK 1.2 was broken by using the
        <code>URL.getPath()</code> in <code>HttpClientHelper</code>. It is now
        fixed and should work both for JDK 1.2 and 1.3.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="add">
        Added a <code>AbstractTestCase.getLogger()</code> method that lets any
        test case class get access to a logger to perform its own logging. Logs
        will go into the Cactus log files.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="update">
        By default, the Cactus log4j configuration file defines a root category
        that logs to the Cactus log file with a DEBUG Priority. There is another
        category for the Cactus classes with a Priority of WARN so that no
        debug logs will be printed by default.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="add">
        Cactus is now using AspectJ under the hood to provide automatic logging
        of entries and exits of methods (for debugging purpose) and to
        automatically initialise the logging subsystem. The next step is to add
        automatic configuration checking using AspectJ. The consequence for end
        users if that they now need to include the <code>aspectjrt.jar</code>
        jar in their classpaths (both client side and server side). It is a
        small jar (25ko) that is packaged in the cactus distribution.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="add">
        Added new java property "<code>cactus.config</code>" to specify location
        of cactus properties file (you pass it on the command line, ex:
        "<code>java -Dcactus.config=conf/mycactus.properties</code>"). If not
        specified, Cactus will look for a "<code>cactus.properties</code>" file
        in the classpath.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="add" due-to="Kaarle Kaila" due-to-email="kaarle.kaila@iki.fi">
        New howto that explains how to use JUnitEE as a Test Runner for
        executing Cactus tests from within the container (i.e. Cactus client
        and server sides live in the same JVM in the container).
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="fix">
        Fixed bug in <code>MockHttpURLConnection</code> that was triggered by
        some modification in HttpUnit. It means that some Cactus 1.2 unit tests
        will fail if run with HttpUnit 1.2.8 (still in CVS on the 12/11/01).
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="update">
        Moved the Jyve FAQ to an internal FAQ - because Jyve was not always up
        and also so that we can have our FAQ in CVS along with the rest of the
        documentation.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="fix" due-to="Chris Hazen" due-to-email="cjkchazen@earthlink.net">
        (<link href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4563">
        Bug #4563</link>).
        The <code>getHost()</code> method of the <code>ServletURL</code> class
        returns the ":" signifing the start of the port number of the host.
        This has side effects in Cactus in that passing
        in the host name and port into the WebRequest method as "127.0.0.1:7001"
        will cause Cactus to use this url "http://127.0.0.1::7001".
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="update">
        Added support for JUnit 3.8 (which has replaced the <code>name()</code>
        method by a <code>getName()</code> one). Note that Cactus is still
        supporting earlier versions of JUnit.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="add">
        Added a new method : <code>WebRequest.setContentType(String)</code>
        (if you don't specify anything it default to
        "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"). This will set the
        content type HTTP header for the request. You can get this value from
        your server code by calling
        <code>HttpServletRequest.getContentType()</code>.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="add">
        Added new method : <code>WebRequest.setUserData(InputStream)</code> to
        allow sending arbitrary data in the request body. Note that calling this
        method will invalidate any parameters that were set to be sent in the
        request body.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="add">
        Added support for testing code which uses
        <code>HttpServletRequest.getReader()</code>. Note: there seems to be
        a bug in Orion 1.4 for using <code>getReader()</code>. It runs fine
        on Orion 1.5 however.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="remove">
        The <code>WebRequest.setMethod()</code> has been removed as deprecating
        it would have led to potential error difficult to locate (as Cactus
        default behaviour is now to pass parameter using GET, whereas before
        it was passing them using POST).
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="update">
        The existing <code>WebRequest.addParameter(name, value)</code> is
        now passing the parameter in the URL query string by default (same as
        calling <code>WebRequest.addParameter(name, value,
        WebRequest.GET_METHOD)</code>.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="add">
        Added a new <code>WebRequest.addParameter(name, value, method)</code>
        where method is either "GET" or "POST". This let you choose on a fine
        grain level, which method you'd like to use to pass a given parameter.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="update">
        Changed the way Cactus passes internal parameters to the redirectors.
        They were previously passed as POST parameters (in the request body).
        They are now passed in the query string of the URL. This is to prepare
        the path for supporting unit testing binary data sent to servlets
        (like files, ...). Thanks to
        <link href="mailto:kevinj@develop.com">Kevin Jones</link> for raising
        awareness of the issue and thanks to

      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="remove">
        Removed <code>ServletTestRequest</code>. It was deprecated in version
        1.2 and is now removed in 1.3. You should use <code>WebRequest</code>
        instead.

        Bug #3427</link>).
        The Cactus HTTP client was following redirects.
        This is wrong for unit tests as we should be able to assert returned
        headers, cookies, ... even for a redirect response.

        New <code>WebRequest.addCookie(String theDomain, String

       New <code>org.apache.cactus.Cookie</code> class that replaces

      <action dev="VMA" type="update">
        Improved cookie handling and support for domains and paths. It means
        that the domain need to match either the redirector host name or
        the host specified in the call to <code>setURL()</code>, otherwise
        the cookie won't get sent. If no domain is used when adding a cookie
        to <code>WebRequest</code> then "locahost" domain is used. The cookie
        path is optional and can be null. If not null, the cookie is only
        sent for requests starting with the path URL.

        New dependency on the Jakarta Commons HttpClient component. It is

        Added logging facility to Cactus, using the Log4j logging framework.
        In order to make it easy on end users, Log4j is only required when
        building Cactus from the sources. It is however optional when running
        Cactus tests. If the log4j jar is present logs will be generated and if
        not, then no log will be generated.

        (<link href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1612">
        Bug #1612</link>). With some servlet engines (like Tomcat) there is a
        risk that the test result will not be committed to the servlet
        application scope *before* the client requests the test result, thus
        getting a no result exception or, worse, getting the result from the
        previous test. Also, if the returned result is bigger than the default
        buffer the server would block until the client side reads the data,
        thus resulting in a deadlock with the above-mentionned bug.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="add">
        Added a new mehod <code>AssertUtils.getResponseAsStringArray()</code>
        that returns the servlet output stream as an array of string (each
        line terminated by a end of line is a string) in the
        same spirit as the <code>AssertUtils.getResponseAsString()</code>
        method which returnes the result as a single string.

        Bug #1582</link>). Applied patch from Arun Katkere in order to prevent

        custom Ant tasks to start and stop a server.
