    <release version="1.2 in CVS">
      <action dev="VMA" type="add">
        Added automatic Ant script support for Tomcat 3.3.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="add" due-to="Jari Worsley" due-to-email="jariw@hyperlink-interactive.co.uk">
        Now all HTTP parameters specified in the URL when using the
        <code>ServletTestRequest.setURL()</code> method are automatically
        passed as real HTTP parameters to the server side, meaning you don't
        have to manually call <code>addParameters()</code>.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="fix" due-to="Kunal Vaishnav" due-to-email="Kunal_Vaishnav@jdedwards.com">
        Fixed bug : URL encoding was applied to cookies so that when passing
        a special in a cookie it would get encoded when trying to retrieve it.
        Thanks to <link href="mailto:jariw@hyperlink-interactive.co.uk">
        Jari Worsley</link> for fixing it.

    <release version="1.1" date="June 18 2001">
      <action dev="VMA" type="add" due-to="Robert Leftwich" due-to-email="digital@ix.net.au">
        Added automatic script support for Enhydra 3.1
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="update">
        Tested with JUnit 3.7.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="add">
        Added automatic script support for Resin 2.0
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="add">
        Added logging facility to Cactus, using the Log4j logging framework.
        In order to make it easy on end users, Log4j is only required when
        building Cactus from the sources. It is however optional when running
        Cactus tests. If the log4j jar is present logs will be generated and if
        not, then no log will be generated.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="fix" due-to="Bob Davison" due-to-email="bob.davison@reuters.com">
        (<link href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1612">
        Bug #1612</link>). With some servlet engines (like Tomcat) there is a
        risk that the test result will not be committed to the servlet
        application scope *before* the client requests the test result, thus
        getting a no result exception or, worse, getting the result from the
        previous test. Also, if the returned result is bigger than the default 
        buffer the server would block until the client side reads the data, 
        thus resulting in a deadlock with the above-mentionned bug.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="add">
        Added a new mehod <code>AssertUtils.getResponseAsStringArray()</code>
        that returns the servlet output stream as an array of string (each
        line terminated by a end of line is a string) in the
        same spirit as the <code>AssertUtils.getResponseAsString()</code>
        method which returnes the result as a single string.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="fix" due-to="Bob Davison" due-to-email="bob.davison@reuters.com">
        (<link href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1610">
        Bug #1610</link>). Corrected handling of multi-line text in
        <code>AssertUtils.getResponseAsString()</code> which was not handling
        correctly line terminators (they were skipped).
      </action>
    </release>

    <release version="1.0" date="May 2 2001">
      <action dev="VMA" type="fix" due-to="Arun Katkere" due-to-email="katkere@praja.com">
        (<link href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1582">
        Bug #1582</link>). Applied patch from Arun Katkere in order to prevent
        the "connexion reset by peer" error message that may appear in Tomcat
        when the connection is broken without reading the requested URL by the
        custom Ant tasks to start and stop a server.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="add">

      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="add">
        Added a new target called <code>deploy-site</code> that automatically
        deploy the generated web site to it's home page on the Jakarta server.
        This will be very useful when integrated with GUMP nightly builds so
        that the web site is always up to date.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="update">
        Added a "assigned to" description for items assigned to someone on the
        todo page + lists all the developers already assigned to tasks.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="update">
        Make the <code>ChangeLogTask</code> work even when not connected to the
        Internet (i.e. use previous <code>cvslog.xml</code> file or generate
        an empty one if non already exists).
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="add">
        Modified the Changes page so that users can see at a glance the list of

        Some minor refactoring of code (added <code>AbstractTestCase</code>,
        modified <code>AbstractHttpClient</code>, <code>JspHttpClient</code>,

        values) in <code>ServletTestRequest</code>.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="update">
        Made the methods <code>setUp()</code> and <code>tearDown()</code>
        protected on the server side so that it is consistent with JUnit.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="update" due-to="Philip Aston" due-to-email="paston@bea.com">
        Modified the Ant <code>runservertest</code> task so that it also works
        when a servlet engine is already up and running and when a server is
        already stopped prior. This is to support intensive debugging mode when
        we don't want to start/stop the server all the time.
      </action>
      <action dev="VMA" type="add">
        Added a

      <action dev="VMA" type="update">
        Updated the Cactus distribution so that everything is contained into one

        Updated the web site installation section to better explain the
        required steps to install Cactus. Namely, it covers

        application</link>.

      <action dev="VMA" type="update">
        Renamed the project from J2EEUnit to Cactus. Although it was a difficult
        decision to make, it had to be done as J2EE is a Sun trademark. Renamed
        all occurrences of J2EEUnit to Cactus and changed package names (from
        <code>j2eeunit.*</code> to <code>org.apache.commons.castor.*</code>.
