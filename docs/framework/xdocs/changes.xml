      <action dev="VMA" type="update" due-to="Philip Aston" due-to-email="paston@bea.com">
        Modified the Ant <code>runservertest</code> task so that it also works
        when a servlet engine is already up and running and when a server is
        already stopped prior. This is to support intensive debugging mode when
        we don't want to start/stop the server all the time.

        Added a

      <action dev="VMA" type="update">
        Updated the Cactus distribution so that everything is contained into one

      <action dev="VMA" type="update">
        Renamed the project from J2EEUnit to Cactus. Although it was a difficult
        decision to make, it had to be done as J2EE is a Sun trademark. Renamed

        <code>j2eeunit.*</code> to <code>org.apache.commons.castor.*</code>.
