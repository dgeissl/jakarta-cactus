  <s1 title="Introduction">

    <p>
      The Cactus Project is an
      <link href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source</link>
      volunteer project under the auspices of the
      <link href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation (ASF)</link>,
      and, in harmony with the Apache webserver itself, it is released under
      a very open license.
      This means there are many ways to contribute to the project
      (coding, documenting, answering questions,
      proposing ideas, reporting bugs, suggesting bug-fixes, etc..).
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin with, we suggest you to subscribe to the
      <link href="mailto:jakarta-commons-subscribe@jakarta.apache.org">
      Jakarta Commons mailing list</link>
      (Indeed, Cactus is part of the Jakarta Commons project).
    </p>
    <note>
      Any mail sent
      on the <link href="mailto:jakarta-commons@jakarta.apache.org">
      Jakarta Commons</link> mailing list concerning Cactus should have it's
      subject prefixed with <code>[cactus]</code> to differentiate it from
      other emails sent for other components (Cactus is only one component of
      Jakata Commons).
    </note>
    <p>
      Then you can download the <link href="downloads.html">latest Cactus
      release</link> or checkout the latest code from
      <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/cvsweb/index.cgi/jakarta-commons/cactus">
      CVS</link>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last, you can check the <link href="todo.html">todo list</link> and jump
      in.
    </p>

  <s1 title="Help Wanted Here">

    <p>
      The rest of this document is mainly about
      contributing new or improved code and/or documentation, but we would also
      be glad to have extra help in any of the following areas:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Answering questions on the <code>jakarta-commons</code> mailing list -
        there is often a problem of having too many questioners and not enough
        experts to respond to all the questions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Testing Cactus (especially its less-frequently-used features) on
        various configurations and reporting back.
      </li>
      <li>
        Debugging - producing reproducable test cases and/or finding causes of
        bugs (bugs can be found in the
        <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/bugs.html">
        bug database</link>).
      </li>
      <li>
        Specifying/analysing/designing new features for Cactus (If you wish to
        get involved with this, please join
        <code>jakarta-commons@jakarta.apache.org</code>),
        install and try out Cactus and read some of the
        <link href="http://www.mail-archive.com/jakarta-commons%40jakarta.apache.org/">
        mail archives</link>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Providing automated Ant scripts for new servlet engines/application
        servers. The list of supported servers can found in the
        <link href="features.html">features</link> list.
      </li>
      <li>
        ... and there is just one other thing - don't forget to tell everyone
        who asks how great Cactus is! ;-)
        The more people that know about and start to use Cactus, the larger the
        pool of potential contributors there will be.
      </li>
    </ul>
 
    <p>
      Thank you very much.

  <s1 title="Contributions of Code and Documentation">
  
    <p>
      We are starting to use an informal system for accepting contributions to
      Cactus. The process varies depending on whether the contribution is a
      modification (i.e. patch) or a fairly standalone item, and whether you 
      have commit access (committers have been granted access by a vote of 
      confidence, so they are assumed to be trustworthy enough
      to make changes directly in CVS. If you submit many good patches, you 
      may be nominated as a committer yourself!)
    </p>

    <p>
      If your contribution requires changing more than a few lines of Cactus
      (code or documentation), then it counts as a <strong>patch</strong>. If 
      you have a patch and would like to see it incorporated into the Cactus
      distribution, take note of the Licensing Requirements listed below, and 
      then post a message to the <code>jakarta-commons</code> mailing list with
      <code>[cactus] [PATCH]</code> in the subject and include a
      <code>diff</code> of your patch against the latest CVS version of the code.
    </p>
  
    <s2 title="Licensing Requirements for the Cocoon Distribution">
  
      <p>
        To avoid legal problems, the Apache Project Management Committee (PMC) 
        have agreed on a policy for under what licensing code can be accepted 
        into Apache projects :
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Source code files must be under the Apache license and must have
          copyright assigned to the Apache Software Foundation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Jar files need only be released under a license that permits free 
          redistribution and does not cover new files added to the jar/library
          (so the GPL and LGPL are not allowed, but MPL and Apache licenses are,
          for example).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>By submitting a patch, you signify your understanding and 
        acceptance of these conditions</strong> - like most open source projects
        , we do not have the resources nor the inclination to obtain signed 
        statements from all contributors!
      </p>
