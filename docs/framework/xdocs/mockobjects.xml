    <s1 title="MO and Server-side tests">

      <p>
        MO is a strategy to unit test java classes in general. As such
        it is also applicable to unit test server side code like Servlets,
        Filters, Taglibs, EJBs, ... See the original article
        <link href="http://mockobjects.sourceforge.net/endotesting.html">
        "Endo-Testing : Unit Testing with Mock Objects"</link> for full details
        on MO. As such it is a challenger to Cactus but we'll see
        in the rest of this article that it is in fact complementary rather than
        a replacement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main goal of MO is to unit test a method in isolation of other
        domain objects. Thus, the MO approach is to fake domain objects
        by using simulated copies instead of the real objects (be careful
        MO does not implement any logic in it's fake objects, that would be
        "stubbing". All behaviours of mock objects are described by the unit
        test itself). This enables to 
        finely unit test the method with no environment
        "noise" and to concentrate on unit testing its logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        When applied to servlet testing, it means mock objects need
        to be provided for simulating the servlet container. In other words
        a mock implementation of the Servlet API need to be provided (of course
        only the Servlet API methods used in the classes under test need to be
        mocked and the approach described in the white paper is to start small
        and develop the mock implementations as they are needed - Note that
        mock objects can even be generated at build time or at run time with
        JDK 1.3 dynamic proxies, see
        <jump anchor="mo_resources">resources</jump>-).
      </p>
      <p>
        Cactus' strategy on the other hand has been to rely on the real 
        container to provide the implementation of the Servlet API.
        In the rest of this article, we'll discuss the pros and cons of each
        approach and draw a conclusion.

            MO let us test methods even before the domain objects are ready,
            i.e. before the implementation are ready. Or before a choice of
            implementation has been made. Thus, for example, it is possible to
            write servlet code before choosing a container. This is in
            accordance with XP that says : "not commit to infrastructure choice 
            before you have to" and "write unit test first".

            the methods that does database access you still need to have a

            this can be alleviated by using Ant and by using a reloadable
            container (the majority of servlet engines do dynamic reloading).

            more subtle refactoring involved like smart handler passing instead
            of more fine grained data (thus leading to better encapsulation). It
            follows XP refactoring rules.

            Using generic MO libraries is against some of MO practices. For
            example, a good practice is to factorize domain object asserts in
            the mock implementation instead of in the test case (this is called
            Refactored Assertions). This is
            possible only if the Mock implementation is project specific. So,
            for some parts, MO does not fit that well with the idea of generic
            libraries. A middle ground could probably be found.

            Using MO is not simple. It needs some discipline and some
            experience. Same as for unit tesing using JUnit, there are some
            methodologies to follow. Some are :
            <ul>
              <li>
                In order not to be weighted down by having to implement myriad
                of MO, these implementation need to be the simplest possible,
                i.e. do nothing method at first and then slowly over time,
                during refactoring, implement what is needed at the current
                time.
              </li>
              <li>
                One must resist the temptation to reimplement the domain logic
                in the MO. There must be almost no logic at all in MO.
              </li>
              <li>
                MO must not make calls to other MOs ... When it happens, there
                is a need for MO refactoring !

            In some cases MO mandates creating API that are no normally

            <code>init(MockObject)</code> method in a Servlet in order to
            initialize a mock version of an internally used domain object. Also
            the code may become more complex (even if more flexible) because
            of the need for testing and not because of business requirements :
            for example, one might need to introduce a factory when it was not
            needed simply to be able to provide MO objects from the factory.

            and might need database specific MO libraries. Also the cost and
            complexity of a generic MO library may be higher than just
            reimplementing from scratch just the needed mocked parts.

    <s1 title="Conclusion">

      <p>
        Mock Objects are a very interesting way of doing unit testing which
        could bridge the gap between standard java class unit testing and
        server-side testing of container components. The biggest
        difference between the way Cactus currently works and Mock Objects is
        that Cactus tests tend to be more coarse-grained and they also ensure
        that developed code will run in the container. On the other hand, Mock
        Objects are more satisfactory intellectually because they are not
        limited to servlet unit testing but cover the whole spectrum of code.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe the graininess Cactus tests is just correct. Having
        fine-grained is nice but it is also a lot of effort. It seems Cactus
        tests are a middle ground where you can still do unit tests fine
        enough and at the same time it gives you *enough* confidence that your
        tests will run fine when deployed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, as described on the <link href="goals.html">Cactus' goals
        page</link>, we think that a framework like Cactus will be more and
        more useful as we use more and more components in the future because 
        it will provide
        the needed confidence that the code will run ok in the container.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also believe that writing correctly MO tests is a difficult process
        that need some training. MO are good because they let you write better
        code but is more difficult to understand than Cactus tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we believe that MO and Cactus are complementary in 2 areas :
        <ul>
          <li>
            During the development phase, MO could be used to unit test the
            code logic only. They run fast and you could use them easily
            inside your IDE. Then every few hours, you'll run the Cactus tests
            which test interactions between objects and container interactions.
            Then you'll run the functional/acceptance tests when you deploy
            to the real platform. Note that this is if you want to do the full
            cycle. A short cycle could simply be Cactus tests and functional
            /acceptance tests.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cactus focuses on server side code. However you can use MO (or
            stubs) within Cactus tests for simulating a JDBC connection, an 
            LDAP connection, ... for example. There are no restrictions.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        We would very much like to have your feedback on MO vs IC. Please post 
        your feedback on the
