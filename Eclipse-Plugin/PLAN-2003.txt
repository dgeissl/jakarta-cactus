MILESTONE 4:

Goal: Improve usability and build improvements

Features to add :

- Ability to leave the server running after the test is finished so that we don’t need to start it again for the next test (needs hot redeploy)

- The user must be able to provide its own web.xml file. Otherwise the plugin will use the one provided by default.

- User interface : no shell popups for Ant tasks, preferences for JAR files (JARs should be included in the Plugin, override by the user possible)

Integration and documentation :

- Find a way to automate building of the Cactus plugin (using Ant) from outside Eclipse and make it part of the Gump runs

- Add full plugin documentation and development documentation (for todos, etc)
