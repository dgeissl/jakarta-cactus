  =============================================================================
    Build file for container management : deploy, start-up, and stop.

    The following property needs to be set in either :
        - a ${user.home}/build.properties
        - a calling Ant script

        test.port              [OPTIONAL] The port that should be used for
                               starting the servers during unit testing. This
                               should be used not to interfere with other
                               running servers. The default is 8080. This
                               property is used when running the test target

    Additionally and depending on the servlet engines whith which you wish to
    run your tests, you'll need to set the following kind of properties
    (see build.properties.sample) :

        <server name>.home.<version>

    Example: For Resin 2.0, you'll need to have a "resin.home.20" property
    defined and pointing to the location where Resin 2.0 is installed.

    This script should be started with the following command line :

        ant <target>

    Run "ant -projecthelp" to get a list of available targets. The default
    target is "dist"
