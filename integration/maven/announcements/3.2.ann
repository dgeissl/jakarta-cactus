The Maven team is pleased to announce the Cactus plugin 3.2 release!

http://maven.apache.org/reference/plugins/cactus

The Maven Cactus plugin is a plugin for Cactus
(http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus) that allows to automatically start 
containers, run Cactus tests and stop the containers.

User-visible changes in this version:

o Added documentation for cactus.bundle property that can be used in POM 
  dependency list. This fixes bug MAVEN-901.
o Updated to use Cactus 1.5-rc1, HttpClient 2.0 rc2 and AspectJ 1.1.1.

Note that this plugin has been tested with Maven 1.0 rc1.
Using it with another version of Maven is at your own risks! :-)

Have fun!
