The Maven team is pleased to announce the Cactus plugin 1.2 release!

http://maven.apache.org/reference/plugins/cactus

The Maven Cactus plugin is a plugin for Cactus
(http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus) that allows to automatically start 
containers, run Cactus tests and stop the containers.

Changes in this version:

o Update the plugin to make it work in Maven beta 8
o Checkstyle fixes for included Sample webapp.
o Add new target cactus:test that runs tests for all containers with a 
  maven.cactus.[container].home property set.
o cactus:single now builds all the code and then runs the testcase specified 
  by the property mavencactustestcase.
  Example: maven cactus:single -Dmavencactustestcase=com.my.company.EasyTest
o Commented out dvsl merging of web.xml due to changes in Maven. Instead uses 
  either included default web.xml or one provided by maven.cactus.webxml.
o Added Checkstyle report to Cactus plugin web site.
o The plugin now works even if not connected to the internet.
o Fixed problem when the <code>web.xml</code> of the application to 
  test was defining security configuration. The Cactus was adding its
  own but the web.xml DTD only supports one. The new implementation
  discards the application security information which is replaced by
  the Cactus definition.

Have fun!
