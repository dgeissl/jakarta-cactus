The Maven team is pleased to announce the Cactus plugin 3.0 release!

http://maven.apache.org/reference/plugins/cactus

The Maven Cactus plugin is a plugin for Cactus
(http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus) that allows to automatically start 
containers, run Cactus tests and stop the containers.

User-visible changes in this version:

o New goal cactus:match added that allows you to run just matching testcases.
  Pass the testcase in using -Dtestmatch=MyTestCase.  This brings to parity the
  cactus plugin with the test plugin for running types of tests.
o New goal cactus:single added that allows you to run just a single testcase.
  Pass the testcase in using -Dtestcase=my.single.TestCase.
o Add xml declaration to generated report. Fixed for character encoding.
o Ability to optionally specify for Tomcat 4x and 5x a directory to which 
  the container will be installed for the tests.        
o Add all user jars that have been marked to be included in the cactus
  test (with the <cactus.bundle>true</cactus.bundle> property
  in dependencies). For example, DBUnit would be a jar you would 
  include in a Cactus test but not in a runtime war.
o Updated to Cactus/Ant of 19th of June 2003 which fixes a bug
  preventing JBoss to start correctly on unix machines (caused by
  an invalid URL file format on unix. Thanks to Chris Lenz for
  fixing it.
o The cactus:compile goal now correctly copy the non java files to the target 
  class directory.
o Major change: updated to use the Cactus/Ant integration built after 
  23rd of May 2003 (it is completely different from the Cactus/Ant
  integration used in version 2.0.

Note that this plugin has been tested with Maven beta 10. Using it with
another version of Maven is at your own risks! :-)
