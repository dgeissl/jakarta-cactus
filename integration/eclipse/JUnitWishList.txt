Wish list for JUnit modifications to allow other plugins to extend it:

- JUnit has a bug where in JUnitBaseLaunchConfiguration.launchTypes(), 
  the VM arguments set in createVMRunner() are overwritten!
  
- API to expose:
  - createVMRunner() to let extensions customize the VM configuration

- Ability to know when tests are finished by letting external code 
  registers against the internal test runner
